**🚀 Revolutionizing Social Media Sentiment Analysis with Emotional Intelligence**

</div>

## 📊 Quick Project Summary
Advanced AI-powered dashboard that collects data from Reddit and YouTube, processes it through custom emotional filtering pipelines, and delivers actionable sentiment insights using aggressive non-neutral classification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI Models**: Hugging Face Transformers (RoBERTa-base)
- **APIs**: Reddit (PRAW), YouTube Data API
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NLTK, Custom Emotional Scoring
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Streamlit Components

## 💥 The Critical Problem We Solved
**The Model-Data Compatibility Crisis**: Traditional sentiment models trained on formal text (reviews, news) fail spectacularly on informal social media content, resulting in 85%+ neutral classifications that provide zero business value.

### 🎯 Our Breakthrough Approach:
Instead of fine-tuning models, we engineered a complete pipeline transformation:


# BEFORE: Simple model inference → 85% neutral results
sentiment = model("I bought an iPhone")

# AFTER: Multi-layer emotional intelligence pipeline
def analyze_sentiment_aggressive(text):
   # Layer 1: Custom emotional scoring
   emotional_intensity = calculate_emotional_intensity(text)
   if emotional_intensity < 0.3: return filtered_out
    
   # Layer 2: Dual-analysis system
   custom_polarity = emotional_word_scoring(text)  # -1.0 to +1.0
   model_prediction = ai_model(text)
    
   # Layer 3: Intelligent override engine
   if abs(custom_polarity) > 0.3:  # Strong emotional signals
       return override_with_confidence_boost(custom_polarity, model_prediction)
    
   return model_prediction_with_neutral_avoidance()

🔧 How We Handled Data-Model Incompatibility
🎭 Emotional Content Filtering
python
def calculate_emotional_intensity(text):
    # 25+ emotional indicators with weighted scoring
    intensity_map = {
        'love': 2.0, 'hate': 2.0, '!!!': 1.2, '😡': 1.8, 
        'ALL_CAPS': 0.8, 'worst': 1.7, 'amazing': 1.8
    }
    return sum(score * text.count(pattern) for pattern, score in intensity_map.items())
🔄 Multi-Strategy Data Collection
python
strategies = [
    "Brand AND (keywords) AND (emotional_indicators)",  # Targeted
    "Brand AND (emotional_indicators)",                 # Fallback  
    "Brand"                                            # Never-fail
]
# Always returns emotional, opinionated content
🧠 Aggressive Classification Engine
python
# Solves conservative model bias by:
# 1. Detecting strong emotional signals (custom polarity)
# 2. Overriding model when emotions are clear
# 3. Boosting confidence for emotional content
# 4. Actively avoiding neutral classifications
